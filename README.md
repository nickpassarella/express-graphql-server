## About
This is where my code lives for following along with the [_Build a GraphQL Server_](https://egghead.io/courses/build-a-graphql-server) course on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io).

## Running the server
1. Clone this repo and navigate to its root directory: `git clone git@github.com:nickpassarella/express-graphql-server.git && cd express-graphql-server`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Start the server: `npm start`
4. Check out the GraphiQL browser: [http://localhost:3000/graphql](http://localhost:3000/graphql)
