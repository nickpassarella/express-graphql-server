## About
This is where I am keeping my code as I follow along with the _Build a GraphQL Server_ course on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/courses/build-a-graphql-server).

## Running the server
Clone this repo and navigate to its root directory. Then:
```
npm install
npm start
```
When the server is running, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000/graphql` to access the GraphiQL browser.
